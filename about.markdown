Viral language can be defined as rhetoric that is used in discussion of major health epidemics or pandemics. Working in conjunction with Timothy Beal, Justin Barber, and Michael Hemenway, our mission is to uncover the possible relation of the increasing use of "viral" language due to various health crises with the increase of this viral language in social contexts like those in regard to immigration. Using data gathered from medical journals, we are building viral language model that can be used to better understand what viral language looks like, as well as applying this knowledge to possibly bring light to the pervasiveness of this type of speech in public discussion of social issues.
